Current Design:
******************
1. All the interfaces configured FW as GW(.1) and the FW is advertising the directly connected interfaces/static redistributed subnets into OSPF on ROF LAN.
2. ROF LAN is our transit network to reach all the destination behind the firewall. we have around 100 firewalls on ROF LAN.
2. Currently ACI is configured as L2 EPG for directly connected interfaces/sub-interface(.1Q Trunk) for all the FWs.

Goal:
1. We want to Migrate the GW(.1) from FW to ACI (L3 EPG) with the limited configuration.Just moving the GW from FW to ACI.
2. On this phase, we're not migrating the exist prod firewall policy into ACI contract.
3. All the traffic has to pass through the same FW, because the firewall policy still in place on deep inspection for all our production traffic.

 
Test case: using Two-Arm L4-l7 feature: We want to try attached design:
***********************************************************************
1. on FW1, source WEB EPG to reach the destination on FW2 for( APP1,APP2, Internet) destinations.
2. on FW2, source (APP1, APP2)EPG to reach DB EPG desintion.
3. From the L3 EPG point of view, we want to send all the traffic back to the same firewall to reach all the destination.
